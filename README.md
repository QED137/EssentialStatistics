## Workflow Details

The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Set up Git repository**: This step checks out the repository on the GitHub Actions runner.

2. **Compile LaTeX document**: The LaTeX document (specified as `main.tex` in the workflow) is compiled into a PDF using the [GitHub Action for LaTeX](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action). The resulting PDF is then saved as an artifact.

3. **Upload PDF file**: The compiled PDF file is uploaded as an artifact, making it accessible for further use or manual download.

## Usage
## LaTeX to PDF Conversion with GitHub Actions

This repository includes an automated workflow that converts a LaTeX document to a PDF using GitHub Actions. The workflow is triggered on each push to the main branch, ensuring that the PDF is always up-to-date with the latest changes to the LaTeX document.

To compile the LaTeX document and generate the PDF locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
2. cd [EssentialStatistics]
